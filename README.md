#RNG Crystal
Manual can be found here: https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/RNG%20Crystal.html
## Mission Settings
Mission Settings are formatted as follows:

`[RNG Crystal]:<SolveMethod>`

The options for `<SolveMethod>` are
- `LuckOnly` to disallow players from selecting the option to decide the tosses
- `CalculationOnly` to prevent the module from solving through luck

Not putting either will allow the player to choose either method, so it is recommended to pick one when making a mission with this module.
